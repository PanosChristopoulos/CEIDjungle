Sadio Mane was transferred to Liverpool in 2016 for a fee of £34 million,
making him the most expensive African player in history at that time.
Since joining Liverpool, Mané among other achievements scored in the 2018 UEFA
Champions League Final. The following season he was joint recipient of the Premier
League Golden Boot with 22 goals, and was part of the Liverpool team that won
the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final.
